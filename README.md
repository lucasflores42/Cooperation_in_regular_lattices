## Game Theory

----------
Supplemental material containing the code for the construction of diverse regular lattices and the respective visualizations
----------
This material is a simplified version with the goal of helping interested readers and students to further develop their own models and variations of a population dynamic in different regular lattices.
The current script is a simplified version of the complete model for the interested reader.
